## Tool

I chose [**Conjointly**](https://conjointly.com/) to carry out this survey for some strong reasons. First, it's budget-friendly. We can use various question styles we require, such as text highlighting, at no cost. It's also user-friendly, allowing us to gather, save responses, and create basic reports without charges.

Secondly, its features stand out. This tool offers the question types we need, including multiple-choice, short answers, and ranges. It even allows text highlighting. Plus, we can easily obtain responses and reports. Noteworthy, Conjointly offers the survey through links and QR codes, making it easier for people to participate. Considering these benefits, Conjointly became our best choice for conducting the survey.

## Survey Plot

1. Gather demographic information from survey participants.

2. Provide three choices: Original version, Simplified version, or Neither, and ask about the preferred option for children with the disorder.

   a. If participants select either the original or simplified version, ask about the aspect they find more beneficial: vocabulary, sentence structure, or understanding.

   b. If participants choose "neither of them," ask them to explain why they find neither option helpful in simple text.

3. Ask whether participants think the original and simplified version as conveying identical meanings.

4. Repeat the same process for the remaining questions comparing the Original and Simplified versions.
